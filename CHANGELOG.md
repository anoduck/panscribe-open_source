--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Project moved apart from my "Palabra" project, which remains a collection of scrips for converting away from Microsoft Word format.
  - This is now its own, distinct, repository/project, called "Panscribe" with a focus specifically on templates for converting markdown into standard manuscript format, for submissions, editing, etc.
  - I'm no longer storing these templates as part of my (private) repository of writings, so I can share the templates and their development more easily. 
  - These templates are no longer a part of my dotfiles repository, though they could be included as a submodule there.
